## Installation
```
go get -v github.com/codeskyblue/gohttpserver
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/codeskyblue/gohttpserver
go build && ./gohttpserver
```

Or download binaries from [github releases](https://github.com/codeskyblue/gohttpserver/releases)

## Usage
Listen on port 8000 of all interfaces, and enable file uploading.

```
./gohttpserver -r ./ --port 8000 --upload
```

Use command `gohttpserver --help` to see more usage.

## Docker Usage
share current directory

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD:/app/public --name gohttpserver codeskyblue/gohttpserver
```

Share current directory with http basic auth

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD:/app/public --name gohttpserver \
  codeskyblue/gohttpserver \
  --auth-type http --auth-http username:password
```

Share current directory with openid auth. (Works only in netease company.)

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD:/app/public --name gohttpserver \
  codeskyblue/gohttpserver \
  --auth-type openid
```

To build image yourself, please change the PWD to the root of this repo.

```bash
cd gohttpserver/
docker build -t codeskyblue/gohttpserver -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Authentication options
- Enable basic http authentication

  ```sh
  $ gohttpserver --auth-type http --auth-http username:password
  ```

- Use openid auth

  ```sh
  $ gohttpserver --auth-type openid --auth-openid https://login.example-hostname.com/openid/
  ```

- Use oauth2-proxy with

  ```sh
  $ gohttpserver --auth-type oauth2-proxy
  ```
  You can configure to let a http reverse proxy handling authentication. 
  When using oauth2-proxy, the backend will use identification info from request headers `X-Auth-Request-Email` as userId and `X-Auth-Request-Fullname` as user's display name. 
  Please config your oauth2 reverse proxy yourself.
  More about [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy).
  
  All required headers list as following.

  |header|value|
  |---|---|
  |X-Auth-Request-Email| userId |
  |X-Auth-Request-Fullname| user's display name(urlencoded) |
  |X-Auth-Request-User| user's nickname (mostly email prefix) |

- Enable upload

  ```sh
  $ gohttpserver --upload
  ```

- Enable delete and Create folder

  ```sh
  $ gohttpserver --delete
  ```

## Advanced usage
Add access rule by creating a `.ghs.yml` file under a sub-directory. An example:

```yaml
---
upload: false
delete: false
users:
- email: "codeskyblue@codeskyblue.com"
  delete: true
  upload: true
  token: 4567gf8asydhf293r23r
```

In this case, if openid auth is enabled and user "codeskyblue@codeskyblue.com" has logged in, he/she can delete/upload files under the directory where the `.ghs.yml` file exits.

`token` is used for upload. see [upload with curl](#upload-with-curl)

For example, in the following directory hierarchy, users can delete/uploade files in directory `foo`, but he/she cannot do this in directory `bar`.

```
root -
  |-- foo
  |    |-- .ghs.yml
  |    `-- world.txt 
  `-- bar
       `-- hello.txt
```

User can specify config file name with `--conf`, see [example config.yml](testdata/config.yml).

To specify which files is hidden and which file is visible, add the following lines to `.ghs.yml`

```yaml
accessTables:
- regex: block.file
  allow: false
- regex: visual.file
  allow: true
```

### ipa plist proxy
This is used for server on which https is enabled. default use <https://plistproxy.herokuapp.com/plist>

```
./gohttpserver --plistproxy=https://someproxyhost.com/
```

Test if proxy works:

```sh
$ http POST https://someproxyhost.com/plist < app.plist
{
	"key": "18f99211"
}
$ http GET https://someproxyhost.com/plist/18f99211
# show the app.plist content
```

If your ghs running behide nginx server and have https configed. plistproxy will be disabled automaticly.

### Upload with CURL
For example, upload a file named `foo.txt` to directory `somedir`

```sh
$ curl -F file=@foo.txt localhost:8000/somedir
{"destination":"somedir/foo.txt","success":true}
# upload with token
$ curl -F file=@foo.txt -F token=12312jlkjafs localhost:8000/somedir
{"destination":"somedir/foo.txt","success":true}

# upload and change filename
$ curl -F file=@foo.txt -F filename=hi.txt localhost:8000/somedir
{"destination":"somedir/hi.txt","success":true}
```

Upload zip file and unzip it (zip file will be delete when finished unzip)

```
$ curl -F file=@pkg.zip -F unzip=true localhost:8000/somedir
{"success": true}
```

Note: `\/:*<>|` are not allowed in filenames.

### Deploy with nginx
Recommended configuration, assume your gohttpserver listening on `127.0.0.1:8200`

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your-domain-name.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8200; # here need to change
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_set_header  Host    $host;
    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    client_max_body_size 0; # disable upload limit
  }
}
```

gohttpserver should started with `--xheaders` argument when behide nginx.

## FAQ
- [How to generate self signed certificate with openssl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl)

### How the query is formated
The search query follows common format rules just like Google. Keywords are seperated with space(s), keywords with prefix `-` will be excluded in search results.

1. `hello world` means must contains `hello` and `world`
1. `hello -world` means must contains `hello` but not contains `world`

## Developer Guide
Depdencies are managed by [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor)

1. Build develop version. **assets** directory must exists

  ```sh
  go build
  ./gohttpserver
  ```
2. Build single binary release

  ```sh
  go generate .
  go build -tags vfs
  ```

Theme are defined in [assets/themes](assets/themes) directory. Now only two themes are available, "black" and "green".
